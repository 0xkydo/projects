# CS251_Proj3
Stanford University, CS251 Project 3: Building a DEX
Authors: Simon Tao ('22), Mathew Hogan ('22), under the guidance of Professor Dan Boneh. 

For this project, I will be working on a web client and two Solidity contracts to implement a
decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. By the end of the project, my exchange will have much of
the functionality possessed by full fledged decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap. Additionally,
I will create your own ERC20 token, which you will then trade over your exchange.
